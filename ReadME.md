# Live Attendance System using OpenCV

Collaborated in a team of three to develop a robust and efficient live attendance system utilizing computer vision techniques. Leveraging Python and computer vision libraries, we designed a solution that accurately captures and records attendance in real-time. The system eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Our project showcased strong teamwork, programming skills, and an understanding of computer vision principles.

## Installation

1. Clone or download all project files to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary packages.
3. Run the `Register.py` file, which loads all the necessary files.
4. Register yourself in the system.
5. Run the `AttendanceProject.py` file to start the live attendance system.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the system's camera is properly connected and functioning.
2. Run the `AttendanceProject.py` file.
3. The system will start capturing video and detecting faces in real-time.
4. Attendees' faces will be recognized and marked as present in the attendance records.
5. Review the attendance records or export them for further processing.
